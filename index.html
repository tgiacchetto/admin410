				<h3><u>History</u></h3>
				<p>DHP was founded by Mary and Jacob Parrot in 1971 right after Jacob got back from serving in the Vietnam War. Mary and Jacob opened a modest store at <strong>8 Dover Road in Durham</strong> which was just a few blocks from their home. In those days DHP focused primarily on dog and cat supplies.<br></br> In 1992, after beginning to expand their offerings to include apparel, accessories and fish supplies, they opened a second store at <strong>46 Main Street in the heart of Durham.</strong> Mary and Jacob have since retired and DHP is now owned and operated by their son, Peter, and his wife Patty. <br></br>DHP now offers one of the largest selections of pet supplies in the region.<br></br>In 2018, DHP opened <strong>a third location in downtown Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</strong></p>
