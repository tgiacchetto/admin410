				<h4>Return Policies</h4>
<p> We at DHP accept returns provided such products are regular priced and unopened items in the original packaging within 15 days <br>
of your purchase with receipt or proof of purchase. Sale items are non-refundable. Unfortunately, if 15 days or more have<br>
 passed since your purchase, we cannot offer you a refund or an exchange. Upon receipt of the returned item, we will fully<br>
 examine it and notify you via email, within a reasonable period of time, whether you are entitled to a return. If you are entitled<br>
 to a return, we will refund your purchase price and a credit will automatically be applied to your<br>
 original method of payment. To follow-up on the status of your return, please contact us at 800-555-PETS.</p>
				</div>	
				<div id="delivery">
				<h4>Delivery</h4>
<p> We typically use business couriers such as FedEx&copy; and UPS&copy; to ship our products. The cost for shipping shall be<br>
 borne by the customer, unless otherwise written, based upon the products purchased and the delivery location. In the event you<br>
 select to upgrade your shipping method for faster delivery (such as Second Day or Overnight), your order must be received and<br>
 credit authorization cleared by 9:00 p.m. ET or your order may not be processed until the following business day.<br>
 Business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the United States. No live animals will be shipped.

				<div id="financing">
				<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>A convenient way for customers to purchase pet supplies is to apply for a DPH Credit Card. If you are at least 18 years<br>
 of age, you can obtain a DPH Credit Card and use it to purchase any store merchandise at any DPH store. One of the<br>
 additional benefits of using the DPH card is from time to time, we offer no interest promotions with equal monthly payment<br>
 options. That means, you can purchase your favorite products and take your time paying for them. See store associate for details. 
<p>
				</div>	
				<div id="special">
				<h4>Special Financing Offer</h4>
<p>For all DPH Credit Card holders, for purchases totaling $500 and up, DPH is pleased to offer 0% APR for 6 months with equal<br>
 payments. Eligible purchases will be charged no interest from date of initial purchase until the balance is paid in full.<br>
 This offer will only be available for a limited time. See store associate for details and additional offers. Interest will<br>
 be charged to your account from the purchase date if the purchase balance is not paid in full within 6 months.
