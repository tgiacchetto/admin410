				<h4>Return Policies</h4>
				<p> We at DHP accept returns provided such products are regular priced and unopened items in the original packaging within 15 days of your purchase with receipt or proof of purchase. Sale items are non-refundable. Unfortunately, if 15 days or more have passed since your purchase, we cannot offer you a refund or an exchange. Upon receipt of the returned item, we will fully examine it and notify you via email, within a reasonable period of time, whether you are entitled to a return. If you are entitled to a return, we will refund your purchase price and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment. To follow-up on the status of your return, please contact us at 800-555-PETS.</p>

				<div id="delivery">
				<h4>Delivery</h4>
				<p> We typically use business couriers such as FedEx&copy; and UPS&copy; to ship our products. The cost for shipping shall be borne by the customer, unless otherwise written, based upon the products purchased and the delivery location. In the event you select to upgrade your shipping method for faster delivery (such as Second Day or Overnight), your order must be received and credit authorization cleared by 9:00 p.m. ET or your order may not be processed until the following business day. Business days are Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays within the United States. No live animals will be shipped.

				<h4>Financing</h4>
				<p>Unfortunately, due to the fact that we are a family run business, we do not provide financing at DHP. We do, however, accept all major credit and debit cards.</p>
